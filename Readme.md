# Sad Joey PowerShell module

## Info

Module compares your level of your sadness with "Sad Joey" using [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/). #SadJoey is a meme created during [PS Conf 2018](http://www.psconf.eu/). See more info about [#SadJoey](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SadJoey) on Twitter.

Module publishes only one function, **Test-SadJoey** with four parameters:
- [string] **Name** (optional) - your name
- [string] **URL** (mandatory) - public URL to your photo
- [switch] **Full* (optional) - if specified, it will return comparison for all basic emotions, except just for sadness
- [string] **Response** - specify response type, which can be String (default value), HTML or InvokeHTML (opens default browser)

If you do not have your photo with public URL, you may want to temporary upload your photo online.
For that, you can use one the many [quick photo sharing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=quick+image+sharing) online services. You just need to get a direct link to your photo which you can test in your browser.

Module is also published as Azure PowerShell function. You can see live in action at this URL: https://sadjoey.azurewebsites.net/api/SJ.

## Application key

The PowerShell module needs Cognitive services application key. It will prompt you to enter one during import. It can be obtained from [module owner](mailto:iricigor@gmail.com?Subject=TestSadJoeyAppKey).

The Azure Functions example has no such limitation.
